            Highfin Reef in Port Blair is a popular coastal spot known for its clear blue waters and vibrant marine life. 
            The reef area offers calm waves and shallow regions that make it suitable for beginners to explore the shoreline and observe small fish and corals. 
            Visitors often enjoy peaceful walks along the coast, watching boats in the distance and experiencing the fresh sea breeze during sunrise and sunset. 
            The location provides a relaxing atmosphere away from the busy town, making it a pleasant place for family outings and quiet evening visits.
